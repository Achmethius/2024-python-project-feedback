Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code for tasks (a), (b) and (c).
- A more general formula for a finite straight line should be used as it is important for the next tasks. See [issue 1](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/2024-python-project-feedback/issues/1).

**Prosperity:**

- A nice plot for task (c) has already been generated and looks good. Consider using the same length scale for both the x-axis and y-axis.
- For a finite straight line, the position of the selected plane could also be an input argument for the user to specify. For an infinite straight line, the magnetic field on the plane remains the same regardless of where the plane is chosen.
