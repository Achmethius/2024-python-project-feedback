### Thuesday (June 11)

Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code for the heuristic method and the minimax algorithm, i.e., (a)-(c).

**Prosperity:**

- Try to modularize the Python script to reduce its length.
- To visualize the results, `Pygame` is suggested.
- Visualizing the results of the minimax algorithm is recommended. Tree structure implemented in the project is highly recommended.
- Consider documenting the code using the `Numpydoc` style.

**Other feedback:**

- Question related to opening database: my colleague Michele told me that the opening database specifies the database for Chess or another game, not for Connect Four.
