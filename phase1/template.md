### Thursday 1 (October 27)

Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our impression when reviewing your repository.
We'll discuss matters in more detail in class.

**Activity:**
- Planning is present, not overview of who did what.
- Commits from everyone. Good!
- Little useful code so far, only for infinite straight conductor? (not very clear)
- Main function does not do anything.

**Creativity:**
- Some example was taken from matplotlib, ok.

**Prosperity:**
- Getting started with Git.
  Given the steep learning curve of git, we're happy that you took a serious shot at it.

**Other feedback:**
- Please, write comments and docstrings.
- Put figure(s) into the report.
- Do not use `math` module. Always use `numpy`.
- Plot: missing labels, units, ... very rough at the moment.
