Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code for tasks (a) and (b).
- A very detailed derivation for the specified finite straight line is provided, which is good. A more general formula for a finite straight line should be used as it is important for the next tasks.
- Two references for the exact solution of the magnetic field induced by a finite straight line have been added. See [issue 1](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/2024-python-project-feedback/issues/1).

**Prosperity:**

- Consider how to visualize the magnetic field generated by (irregular) polygon shape.

**Other feedback:**

- Is German allowed to present? I think so.
- Is it enough to only finish the basic requirements? I don't know the grading details yet, and I need to check it with Bernard and my collegue.
