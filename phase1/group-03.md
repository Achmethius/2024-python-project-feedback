### Wednesday (June 12)

Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code for tasks (a) and (b).
- A more general formula for a finite straight line should be used as it is important for the next tasks. See [issue 1](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/2024-python-project-feedback/issues/1).

**Prosperity:**

- Consider how to visualize the magnetic field generated by (irregular) polygon shape.
- For a finite straight line, the position of the selected plane could also be an input argument for the user to specify. For an infinite straight line, the magnetic field on the plane remains the same regardless of where the plane is chosen.

**Other feedback:**

- Whether needs to submit the Latex soruce code? I need to check.

### Wednesday (June 19)

Summary of feedback after second week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Tasks (a)-(c) have been finished.
- The way task (c) is visualized is different from the requirement, but it's good. Based on it, more complicated plots can be generated.
