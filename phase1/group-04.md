Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code covers nearly all basic requirements and some extensions. It's good.
- The main problem with the current implementation is efficiency due to the use of `SymPy`. One way to address this issue is to use the exact solution of an infinite wire. See [issue 1](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/2024-python-project-feedback/issues/1).

**Prosperity:**

- Nice 2D plots have been implemented for the magnetic field induced by the current in a polygon coil.
- Choose different planes to show the magnetic field when it is not easy to visualize using a 2D plot.

**Other feedback:**

- Consider the numerical issues when computing the magnetic field for points near the wire.
