Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code for the heuristic method, i.e., (a)-(b).
- The Minimax algorithm needs to be implemented.

**Prosperity:**

- A `Tree` data structure is constructed. More details may need to be added, such as adding, deleting, modifying, and searching. However, this may be too much for this stage. An easier approach may be to simply print the results recursively instead of using a `Tree`. Another option is to use a `Tree` data structure from another package instead of implementing it yourself. After a quick search, I found that the package `treelib` may satisfy your needs.
