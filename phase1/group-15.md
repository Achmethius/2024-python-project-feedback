Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- A detailed analysis of the heuristic and Minimax algorithms.

**Prosperity:**

- To visualize the results, using a printing matrix or `Pygame` is suggested.

**Other feedback:**

- Regarding the heuristic approach: After googling, I found that a heuristic is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on the available information to decide which branch to follow. See [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)) for more details. Simply put, it is the function to evaluate the score as we discussed.
- Thanks for correcting me on the rule of the game.
