Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing useful code for tasks (a) and (b).
- Working on the plot.

**Prosperity:**

The entire algorithm for the basic requirement has been implemented.

**Other feedback:**

For how to plot:

- Create a grid of complex numbers representing the complex plane.
- Apply the Newton method to each point in the grid.
- Assign colors based on the converged root for each point.
- Use matplotlib to display the fractal by plotting the grid with assigned colors.

A similar plot is used for the number of iterations until convergence.
