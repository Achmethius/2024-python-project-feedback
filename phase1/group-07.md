Summary of feedback after first week

Below, you'll find a summary of our discussion.

**Activity:**

- Existing code for (a) and (c). The plot is nice! More general code should be implemented to deal with arbitrarily complex polynomials with known roots.

**Prosperity:**

- Trying different color schemes in Matplotlib. This is also good.

**Other feedback:**

- To provide an option for the color scheme, `argparse` could be used to specify the choices of all color schemes from `Matplotlib`.
